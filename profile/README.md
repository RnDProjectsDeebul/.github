## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->


Some Mandatory ToDos:

1. Please update you GitHub wiki meeting notes with every meeting updates.
    - Before each meeting pre-fill the wiki with what you want to discuss. 
2. Please add SCRUM goal page in wiki and add your next month goal. 
    - Every month 15th is your scrum deadline
    - So for next May15th your goal should be defined
    - You should define it yourself and then discuss with me for inputs
3. Please convert your current task to an issue and self assign so that I know what you are working by looking at your github issues.
